# Anomaly Detection Project

This project focuses on anomaly detection using machine learning techniques. The notebook contains the code and analysis for detecting anomalies in a given dataset. The primary objectives of this project are to identify unusual patterns or outliers in the data that deviate from normal behavior and may indicate potential anomalies or anomalies.  

The aim of this project is to enlight what I've leant during J. Sprauel *(Data Scientist at Thales Alenia Space, Toulouse)* classes.
During his classes, I've mainly worked on machine learning and deep learning lessons as well as optimizations subjects.
Here is my work on the anomaly detection project andthe instructions given:

*An aircraft system expert comes to see you (data scientist) with this dataset, and asks you to Build an algorithm to detect windows that are abnormal.*

* 1. With this information and no more, formulate the problem, and tell him what is feasible and what is not.
* 2. Develop an approach to answer his question in the best way possible.
* 3. Present your findings to the expert, in a way he can understand and help you validate your results...

## Overview

The notebook contains the code and analysis for detecting anomalies in the dataset. The main tasks performed in this project include:

### 1. Data Loading
- Loading the dataset into the notebook environment.
- Inspecting the structure of the dataset, including its dimensions and feature types.
- Checking for missing values or inconsistencies in the data.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Conducting descriptive statistics to summarize the key characteristics of the data, such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc.

### 3. Anomaly Detection Techniques
- Implementing various anomaly detection algorithms, such as Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), One-Class SVM, etc.
- Training the models on the dataset and evaluating their performance.
- Tuning hyperparameters to improve model performance if necessary.

### 4. Detection and Interpretation
- Detecting anomalies in the dataset using the trained models.
- Investigating the detected anomalies to understand their nature and potential causes.
- Formulating hypotheses or questions for further investigation based on the detected anomalies.
