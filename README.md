# Introduction to this repository 

The aim of this repository is to show all personal and school projects during my studies or free time.
Some of them are quite old and were carried out during the early stages of my studies and are therefore not necessarily optimized from a technical and readability point of view.
They will be updated for those who need it as the directory is built up.  

You will find mostly projects about machine learning (deep learning, supervised learning, unsupervised learning...), sql projects for the management of databases and some projects based on the idea of setting up artificial intelligence in a given context.

Some of these projects was achieved with a group, others by myself. For the projects done in group, the members of the group will be anonymized, and those who gave the subjects too.
