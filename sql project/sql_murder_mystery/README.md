# SQL Murder Mystery

While looking for databases to work on, I found the SQL Murder Mystery database and problem.
The aim was to found the murderer of a case by looking through the tables, finding the witnesses and the different charasteristics that identify the suspect.

# What I used for solving the mystery
* I read the [prompt_experienced](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries/blob/master/prompt_experienced.pdf) file
* I downloaded the [sql-murder-mystery.db](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries/blob/master/sql-murder-mystery.db) file.
