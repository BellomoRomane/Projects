# Music Store Project

*Carried out in May 2024*

While looking for databases to work with, I found the Music Store database (Excel files) and questions. The aim was to give an analysis of this database by answering them.

# What I uses for answering the questions

- The [music store data](https://github.com/rishabhnmishra/SQL_Music_Store_Analysis/blob/main/music%20store%20data.zip) I've downloaded.
- The [questions](https://github.com/rishabhnmishra/SQL_Music_Store_Analysis/blob/main/Music%20Store%20Analysis-Questions.pdf) for our analysis.
- I've built the database on **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio** (SSMS).
- I've connected Visual Studio Code to SSMS for writing my queries and answering the questions.
