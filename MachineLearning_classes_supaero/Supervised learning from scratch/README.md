# Supervised Learning Models Project

*Carried out in February 2023*

This project focuses on implementing and evaluating various supervised learning models for a given machine learning task. The notebook contains the code and analysis for training and evaluating supervised learning models on a dataset. The primary objectives of this project are to compare the performance of different algorithms, select the best-performing model, and analyze its behavior. The main task having been evaluated was the conception a machine learning algorithm from scratch, its efficency, and if it worked.

## Overview

The notebook contains the code and analysis for training and evaluating supervised learning models. The main tasks performed in this project include:

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Loading the dataset into the notebook environment.
- Preprocessing the data, including handling missing values, and correlation between the different features.

### 2. Model Training and Evaluation
- Implementing from scratch a supervised learning algorithm, here we chose Ridge.
- Evaluating the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error.

### 3. Model Interpretation and Analysis
- Interpreting the trained model to understand its behavior and decision-making process.
- Analyzing the results of the model to gain insights into the underlying patterns or relationships in the data.
- Drawing conclusions and making recommendations based on the analysis.
