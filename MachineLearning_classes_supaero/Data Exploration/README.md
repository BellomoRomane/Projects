# Data Exploration Project

This project focuses on exploring a dataset using various techniques in data analysis and visualization. The dataset used in this project was given by the three examinators of this project. It is a dataset listing a large amount of music with their type, their author, and others descriptions such as popularity, loudness, duration... The primary objectives of this project are to gain insights into the underlying patterns and relationships within the data, identify potential areas for further analysis or modeling, and communicate findings effectively through visualizations and descriptive statistics.

## Overview

The notebook contains the code and analysis for exploring the dataset. The main tasks performed in this project include:

### 1. Data Loading 
- Loading the dataset into the notebook environment.
- Inspecting the structure of the dataset, including its dimensions and feature types.
- Checking for missing values or inconsistencies in the data.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Conducting descriptive statistics to summarize the key characteristics of the data, such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
- Visualizing distributions of individual features using histograms, box plots, and density plots.
- Exploring relationships between different features through scatter plots, correlation matrices, or pair plots.
- Identifying any outliers or anomalies in the data.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Transforming or creating new features based on domain knowledge or insights gained from EDA.
- Handling categorical variables through encoding or feature engineering techniques.

### 4. Insights and Interpretation
- Drawing insights from the exploratory analysis to understand the underlying patterns or trends in the data.
- Formulating hypotheses or questions for further investigation.
- Communicating findings effectively through narrative descriptions and visualizations.
